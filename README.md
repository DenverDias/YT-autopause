# YT-autopause
jQuery snippet for automatically pausing every other YouTube embed in the page.

## How to use
1. Simply include the script in your webpage after where you've included jQuery.
```
<script src="path/to/jquery.autopause.js"></script>
```

You can instead use autopause.js with or without jQuery at the bottom of the page...

That's it...
